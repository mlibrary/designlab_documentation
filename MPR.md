## **Before Orientation Begins**

*   _Check over all cable connections and make sure that nothing is missing or disconnected._
*   _Meet people scheduled to do Orientation either outside the Media Production Rooms or in the Winberg Room._
*   _Wait a few minutes to make sure everyone has arrived (but not full Michigan time)._

## **Introduction**

*   We do the Orientation for both rooms at the same time, first the Winberg room and then the Perlstein room
*   The Winberg room is for media production (audio + video + photo), while the Perlstein room is for post-production and graphic design.
*   After completing the Orientation, we will add your uniqname to the list in our room reservation system and you will be able to make reservations 24/7, 4 hours at a time.
*   The Orientation is not meant for you to become a pro at all of this equipment. If you’d like a more detailed tutorial on one or more things in the Media Production Rooms, please schedule a one-on-one consultation with our staff.
*   **Make sure that people using the rooms bring their own hard drive or some other way to save their files not on the computer itself.** If they want to use Google Drive, make sure to delete it off the machine before logging out. Not doing so risks filling up the computer and eventually necessitating a full wipe of the machine (losing all files).
*   When you are all done using the station, make sure you log out completely, otherwise others won’t be able to log in.

## **Audio Recording + Editing Station**

This station is primarily for advanced audio production, editing, and music creation. It has specialized equipment and software and is primarily intended for advanced users. 95% of the time, the Yeti will be perfectly fine for their vocal or audio recording needs. If you are interested in using this for recording and haven’t used it before, you can schedule a separate session.

We have the following software on the iMac:

*   Audacity (Open-source audio editing platform, best for beginners)
*   Garageband (Introductory recording software, meant for beginning users)
*   Adobe Audition (More advanced audio editing and processing program, useful especially for cleaning audio)
*   Pro Tools (Industry standard recording software, meant for advanced users)
*   Ableton (Electronic music production software, used with the Ableton Push II hardware and meant for advanced users)
*   Logic Pro (Full-featured Apple recording software, meant for advanced users)

_Due to the nature of the equipment and to prevent damage, please follow these steps when using the Audio Station._

1.  Turn on computer (if not already on) and log in with your uniqname and password. **[_It is not necessary for the Design Lab Staff person to log in_]**.

2.  Turn on Scarlett (red box at bottom right of computer) with the switch on the back right of the box.

3.  If you are using microphone in the booth, confirm microphone plugged into front left input of machine and push "48V" [short for “48 volts”] button on front left of machine (it will light up when turned on). This will send the necessary power through the XLR cable to power the microphone. If this is not turned on, you will not get any signal. If you are not using the Neumann microphone, you don’t need to use 48V.

4.  Turn on each speaker using the switch on its back. **Do not adjust levels on speakers**, you will use the Scarlett to adjust recording (gain) and the **MONITOR** knob for listening (volume) levels. See diagram for specific buttons on the Scarlett and their functions.

## **Finding the Right Audio Level**

*   In general, you want the recording level to be between **-12dB and -10dB**. You should be able to see audio level bars in your program (Garageband, Logic, Audition, ProTools, etc) that correspond to your signal level.
*   When the Scarlett is receiving a good audio signal, the ring around the knob will flash green. If it gets too high, you will see it flash red, and you are running the risk of distortion and damage to the microphone.
*   Please note: **the recording (gain) level will need to be set fairly high to get a decent signal (use the silver mark as a guide)**, but make sure it does not go into the red!

## **Listening**

*   Use the **Monitor** knob (and only this knob) to control the volume coming through the speakers. Mixing volume levels risks damaging the equipment or getting an artificially high or low signal.
*   If you want to listen to headphones, make sure you have ones that have a quarter-inch adapter on them (it should look like a guitar amp cable) and that they fit into the Scarlett on the lower front right side of the device. If you don’t have headphones, you can check out a pair from the front desk.
*   When using headphones, make sure the **Monitor** knob is turned all the way down. Even with headphones plugged in, the sound will still go through the speakers.

**When you are finished with the station:**  
Please turn the equipment off in the following order to prevent damage:

1.  Turn off speakers with switches on the back of each speaker.

2.  Turn off 48V button on the front of the Scarlett.

3.  Turn off Scarlett with switch on the back.

4.  Logout of computer (if you haven't already).

## **Winberg Video Station**

The Video station consists of lights, camera + microphone, and backdrop:

Lights

*   2 to the left and right of the cart, hanging from near the top of the wall; turn on and off to make sure they work

*   The other light is to the bottom left of the green screen. Look for four switches and turn them all on to make sure they work.

Green screen

*   It has four different backdrops, which can be cycled through by gently pulling down (demonstrate this).

*   For people who want to specifically use the green screen, make sure they are aware of the limitations of both the lights and the screen itself, and that they would probably be better off going to the Personal Studio in the Duderstadt.

Video Station

*   Turn Camera On (switch on top of the camera, near the back-left side). Flip it forward to **Camera**.

*   Unless you want to record without audio, make sure the microphone on top of the camera is switched to **ON** (the upper switch on the back of the microphone set to the middle position or **|** ). The last setting is not necessary because it automatically cuts out low frequencies (such as wind when recording outdoors) and there shouldn’t be any wind in the room!

*   Once you turn the camera on and set it to the correct position, there should be a green light on. (If the light is red, replace the battery or find a staff person to get a new battery.) The bottom switch should be ignored except for advanced users.

*   Set camera to AUTO on the right back top of the camera (all exposure and focus settings will be made for you).

*   Make sure Blue INOGENI cable is connected to the back of the iMac.

*   Log in and open **Quicktime Player** (on the dock at the bottom of the Desktop, the large **Q** icon). Please note that the second monitor mirrors whatever is on the iMac.

*   It opens quickly, look for the new menu at the top of the screen. Under **File**, choose **New Movie Recording**.

*   The window that opens should show what the camera sees. If not, click on the triangle next to the **Record** button and choose the **INOGENI** option. The other options (microphone, etc) will change automatically.

*   Once you have set up your shot, hit **Record** in Quicktime.

*   Once you are finished recording, hit **STOP** (the button that used to be **RECORD**). If you want to save this footage, go under **FILE** and choose **EXPORT**. Save as **1080p** and then you will have a file ready to be brought into any editing program (iMovie, Final Cut, Premiere, etc).

**Point them to the support signs at both stations** If there is a problem with any of the equipment or software, please do the following:

1.  Save your work!

2.  Find a Design Lab or Library staff member.

3.  If they are unable to solve the problem, email [shapirodesignlab@umich.edu](mailto:shapirodesignlab@umich.edu) and we will either attempt to solve the problem or escalate it to ITS.

Perlstein Editing Room
----------------------

The Perlstein Editing Room is primarily designed for video and other visual media post-production (after you’ve created your content initially), but it also can be used for graphic design, CAD programs, and most other things you can think of.

**Overview**

*   Unlike the Winberg room, you reserve each station individually within the Perlstein room. Please be aware that someone else may be using the other station during your reservation (you will see this when you make your reservation). Please be respectful and share the space.

*   There are two machines in the Perlstein room
    *   Station A: Retina 5K iMac with 22” Cintiq tablet
        *   If you need to borrow a stylus, you can check one out at the circulation desk. If you would like to use your own, please check its compatibility or send us the make and model of it and we can check its compatibility.
        *   The power button for the Cintiq is on the back center of the machine, and you can tilt it higher or lower by pressing on both paddles on the back of the machine. [demonstrate this]
    *   Station B: Mac Pro (late 2013) with two 4K monitors
    *   Station A was originally designed for graphic design and animation, while Station B was originally designed for high end video editing and motion graphics. However, unless you are working on extremely large files or other high-demand projects, both stations will serve your needs.

**Reservation**

*   When you make a reservation, check out a key from the front desk when it is time.
*   You cannot make same-day reservations within our reservation system. If you need it on the same day, please email shapirodesignlab@umich.edu and we will do our best to accommodate your request.
*   When finished, make sure you log out from the computer (if you don’t, no one else will be able to log in) and that the doors are closed behind you.

**Policies**

*   No food or drink except for water (and be careful with the water).
*   If anyone else will be using the room with you, they must go through an Orientation as well.
*   Don't bring any furniture into the room(s)
*   Point them to the support sign
    *   If there are problems with the software or equipment, please find a staff member or Design Lab staff person. If we can’t solve the problem, email shapirodesignlab@umich.edu and we will send it to ITS.

***{pause and ask for questions}***

**Make sure people have an account in the Library’s room reservation system**

*   Design Lab staff person should log into the iMac
*   Open Chrome and click on the “Scheduling Page” bookmark beneath the URL bar
*   Have each person log in with their uniqname
    *   If they are prompted to create an account, have them do so (the phone number is not necessary)
    *   If they come to the front screen of the reservation system, they are all set and don’t need to do anything else.
*   If there are any errors (Ambiguous User, etc) please make a note of them on the signup sheet.

**Write down uniqnames**

On the 2-column sheet in the binder, write down each person’s uniqname. Justin will then have these people added to the Reservations list within 24 hours.

**After all Orientations are complete, return binder to the Workshop.**
